#  0.7 - Added the GPG variable at the top for people to adjust for their version of GPG in case both are 
#        Installed on their system.  I will automate the check somehow later.  I'll just leave this part here
#        for now: gpg --version | cut -d. -f1 | grep -i gpg | cut -d" " -f3 
#
#  0.6 - Turns out if you sign a message there is no need to add yourself as a recipient to read it     
#        later so I removed that part. Also fixed MYKEY variable so it didn't throw errors 7-2-2016 -DD
#
#  0.5 - Added variable at top for user's key and stuff to sign and encrypt messages to yourself as
#        well as the intended recipient.  That way you can decrypt your sent messages as well.


USAGE:

Make sure you already have GPG setup on your system and your keys and your contact's keys setup.

Edit the GPGEncrypt.sh file and change the MYKEY variable to either your key's ID or fingerprint.


chmod +x GPGEncrypt.sh.* 

./GPGEncrypt.sh.*
